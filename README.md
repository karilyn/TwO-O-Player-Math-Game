# TwO-O-Player-Math-Game

# Description
A two-player math game where players take turns answering simple math addition problems from the command line. A new math question is generated each turn by using two random numbers between one and 20. The player whose turn it is must answer correctly or lose a life.

# Details
Both players start with three lives and lose one for every incorrect answer. At the end of each turn, the game outputs the new scores for both players.

The game ends when one of the players loses all of their lives. At this point, the game announces who won and the other player's score.
